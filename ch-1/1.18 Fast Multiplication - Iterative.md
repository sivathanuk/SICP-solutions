**Exercise 1.18**. Using the results of exercises 1.16 and 1.17, devise a procedure that generates an iterative  process for multiplying two integers in terms of adding, doubling, and halving and uses a logarithmic  number of steps.

---
solution (*code snippet*):
```
(define (mul-log-count a b)
  (mul-logiter a 0 b))
  
(define (mul-logiter a product b)
  (cond ((= b 0) product)
        ((is-even b) (mul-logiter (double a) product (/ b 2)))
        (else (mul-logiter a (+ product a) (- b 1)))))

```
