**Exercise 1.17**. The exponentiation algorithms in this section are based on performing exponentiation by  means of repeated multiplication. In a similar way, one can perform integer multiplication by means of  repeated addition. The following multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that our language can  only add, not multiply) is analogous to the expt procedure:

```
(define (* a b)  
	(if (= b 0)  
		0  
		(+ a (* a (- b 1)))))

```  

This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in b. Now suppose we include, together with addition,  operations double, which doubles an integer, and halve, which divides an (even) integer by 2. Using  these, design a multiplication procedure analogous to fast-expt that uses a logarithmic number of  steps.

solution (*code snippet*):
```

; function: *
(define (* a b)
  (if (= b 0) 0
      (+ a (* a
              (- b 1)))))

; function: double
(define (double x) (+ x x))

; function: half
(define (half x) (/ x 2))

; function: is-even
(define (is-even x) ( = (remainder x 2) 0))

; function: fast-mul
(define (fast-mul a b)
  (cond ((= b 0) 0)
        ((is-even b) (double (fast-mul a (half b))))
        (else (+ a (double (fast-mul a (half (- b 1))))))))

; compare runtime
(define start1 (runtime))
(* 12324 98999)
(define end1 (runtime))
(display "runtime1:")
(- end1 start1)

(define start2 (runtime))
(fast-mul 12324 98999)
(define end2 (runtime))
(display "runtime2:")
(- end2 start2)
