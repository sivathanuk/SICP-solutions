**Exercise 1.25**. Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing expmod. After  all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written  
```
(define (expmod base exp m)  
	(remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))  
```
Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

In the above expmod function, the remainder operation is performed on a huge number (base^m). This will slow down the algorithm. 

But in the below (faster) expmod function, the base is reduced by half at every step and remainder is calculated recursively
```
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((is-even exp)
         (remainder (sq (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                     m))
        (else
         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                         m))))
```
