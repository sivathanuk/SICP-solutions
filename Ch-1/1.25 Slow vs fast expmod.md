```
(define (expmod base exp m)  
	(remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))  
```

In the above expmod function, the remainder operation is performed on a huge number (base^m). This will slow down the algorithm. 

But in the below (faster) expmod function, the base is reduced by half at every step and remainder is calculated recursively
```
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((is-even exp)
         (remainder (sq (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                     m))
        (else
         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                         m))))
```
