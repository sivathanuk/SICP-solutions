In the expmod definition above,  the function expmod is called twice everytime the function is invoked. 

Orignally in the expmod function calling square, it's a O(log n) process. In the modified definiton of expmod, we are undoing the advantage (half exp, square) provides. 

So the modified expmod function is similar to the process that just uses (dec n), which is a O(n) process.

Let T(n) denote the time taken to compute expmod,

T(n) = T(n/2) + c
		= T(n/4) + c + c
		= T(n/8) + c + c + c
		= c log n 

Let T'(n) denote the time taken to compute expmod,
in the modified expmod function,

T'(n) = 2 T'(n/2) + c
		 = 4 T'(n/4) + 2c + c
		 = 8 T'(n/8) + 4c + 2c + c
