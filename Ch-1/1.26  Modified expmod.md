**Exercise 1.26**. Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing exercise 1.24. His fast-prime? test  seems to run more slowly than his prime? test. Louis calls his friend Eva Lu Ator over to help. When  they examine Louis's code, they find that he has rewritten the expmod procedure to use an explicit  multiplication, rather than calling square:  

```
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)  (remainder (* (expmod base
                                            (/ exp 2)
                                            m)
                                    (expmod base
                                            (/ exp 2)
                                            m))
                                 m))
        (else  (remainder (* base (expmod base
                                          (- exp 1)
                                          m))
                          m))))
```
"I don't see what difference that could make,'' says Louis. " I do."  says Eva. "By writing the procedure  like that, you have transformed the (log n) process into a (n) process." Explain.

**solution**:

In the expmod definition above,  the function expmod is called twice everytime the function is invoked. 

Orignally in the expmod function calling square, it's a O(log n) process. In the modified definiton of expmod, we are undoing the advantage (half exp, square) provides. 

So the modified expmod function is similar to the process that just uses (dec n), which is a O(n) process.

Let T(n) denote the time taken to compute expmod,

T(n) = T(n/2) + c
		= T(n/4) + c + c
		= T(n/8) + c + c + c
		= c log n 

Let T'(n) denote the time taken to compute expmod,
in the modified expmod function,

T'(n) = 2 T'(n/2) + c
		 = 4 T'(n/4) + 2c + c
		 = 8 T'(n/8) + 4c + 2c + c
